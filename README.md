# IoT Hydroponic System

- This repository serves as the Final Year Project 2021 for UTAR's Bachelor of Electronic Engineering with Honours degree programme.
- The main project objective is to develop an IoT NFT hydroponic system with online monitoring and automated regulating capabilites.
- 2 ESP32s are used as the system's microcontrollers, namely master and slave.
- 2 Custom PCBs and junction boxes are introduced in this project. 
- Each directory consists of a README.md to describe relevant sources codes.
